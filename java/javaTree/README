  The Simples in Java is under test and may not work correctly!!!

  The files Simples.* and Interp.java are specific to the compiler.
  Simple hierarchy of Node types to replace C's union.
  Postfix macros are replaced by Postfix class methods.

  The use of the interpreter is straitforward, after doing 'make':
  $ java -cp Simples.jar Interp ../examples/tri.spl

  To create i386 executable you must, after doing 'make' here and in the
  '../runtime/' directory:
	Compile:	$ java -cp Simples.jar Simples tri.spl
	     or:	$ java -jar Simples.jar tri.spl
	Assemble:	$ nasm -felf tri.asm
	Link:		$ ld -o tri tri.o ../runtime/lib.o ../runtime/linux.o
	and run:	$ ./tri

  To compile using instruction selection and Postfix:
	Compile:	$ java -cp Simples.jar Selector tri.spl
	(then Assemble, Link and run as above)
  To compile using greedy register allocation and optimized instruction
  selection, use i386j.l, i386j.y and i386j.brg:
	Compile:	$ java -cp Simples.jar Optimizer tri.spl
	(then Assemble, Link and run as above)
  To create a Postfix debug version:
  	Compile:	$ java -cp Simples.jar Simples -debug tri.spl
	Debug:		$ pfd tri.spl
