  The Simples in Java is under test and may not work correctly!!!

  The files Simples.* and Interp.java are specific to the compiler,
  although the nodes Print, Read, Variable and Assign are too restrictive
  for use in other more powerfull languages.

  The use of the interpreter is straitforward, after doing 'make':
  $ java -cp Simples.jar Interp ../examples/tri.spl

  To create i386 executable you must, after doing 'make' here and in the
  '../lib/' directory:
	Compile:	$ java -cp Simples.jar Simples tri.spl
	Assemble:	$ nasm -felf tri.asm
	Link:		$ ld -o tri tri.o ../runtime/lib.o ../runtime/linux.o
	and run:	$ ./tri

  To create a Via debug version:
  	Compile:	$ java -cp Simples.jar Simples -debug tri.spl
	Debug:		$ viad tri.spl
